# Crowdfund

A new way of funding a project or venture by raising small amounts of money from a large number of contributors.
Contributors send ether directly to contract address , a request for funds is raised for a given deadline.
When the raised amount meets the target , a vote request is created.
Finally balance is transferred if majority votes are in favour.
